class Collect:
    """Collect data from the loader relevant to the specific task.

    This keeps the items in ``keys`` as it is, and collect items in
    ``meta_keys`` into a meta item called ``meta_name``.This is usually
    the last stage of the data loader pipeline.
    For example, when keys='imgs', meta_keys=('filename', 'label',
    'original_shape'), meta_name='img_metas', the results will be a dict with
    keys 'imgs' and 'img_metas', where 'img_metas' is a DataContainer of
    another dict with keys 'filename', 'label', 'original_shape'.

    Args:
        keys (Sequence[str]): Required keys to be collected.
        meta_name (str): The name of the key that contains meta infomation.
            This key is always populated. Default: "img_metas".
        meta_keys (Sequence[str]): Keys that are collected under meta_name.
            The contents of the ``meta_name`` dictionary depends on
            ``meta_keys``.
            By default this includes:

            - "filename": path to the image file
            - "label": label of the image file
            - "original_shape": original shape of the image as a tuple
                (h, w, c)
            - "img_shape": shape of the image input to the network as a tuple
                (h, w, c).  Note that images may be zero padded on the
                bottom/right, if the batch tensor is larger than this shape.
            - "pad_shape": image shape after padding
            - "flip_direction": a str in ("horiziontal", "vertival") to
                indicate if the image is fliped horizontally or vertically.
            - "img_norm_cfg": a dict of normalization information:
                - mean - per channel mean subtraction
                - std - per channel std divisor
                - to_rgb - bool indicating if bgr was converted to rgb
        nested (bool): If set as True, will apply data[x] = [data[x]] to all
            items in data. The arg is added for compatibility. Default: False.
